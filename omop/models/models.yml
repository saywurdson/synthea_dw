For US addresses, these represent either a 3-digit abbreviated Zip code as provided by many sources for patient protection reasons, the full 5-digit Zip or the 9-digit (ZIP + 4) codes. Unless for specific reasons analytical methods should expect and utilize only the first 3 digits. For international addresses, different rules apply.

      - name: condition_start_date

      - name: condition_start_datetime
      - name: condition_end_date

      - name: condition_end_datetime
      - name: condition_type_concept_id
        description: This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Condition record, as in whether the condition was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources.
      - name: condition_status_concept_id
        description: This concept represents the point during the visit the diagnosis was given (admitting diagnosis, final diagnosis), whether the diagnosis was determined due to laboratory findings, if the diagnosis was exclusionary, or if it was a preliminary diagnosis, among others.
      - name: stop_reason
        description: The Stop Reason indicates why a Condition is no longer valid with respect to the purpose within the source data. Note that a Stop Reason does not necessarily imply that the condition is no longer occurring.

      - name: visit_occurrence_id
        description: The visit during which the condition occurred.
      - name: visit_detail_id
        description: The VISIT_DETAIL record during which the condition occurred. For example, if the person was in the ICU at the time of the diagnosis the VISIT_OCCURRENCE record would reflect the overall hospital stay and the VISIT_DETAIL record would reflect the ICU stay during the hospital visit.
      - name: condition_source_value
        description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the condition that occurred. For example, this could be an ICD10 or Read code.
      - name: condition_source_concept_id
        description: This is the concept representing the condition source value and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Condition necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network.
      - name: condition_status_source_value
        description: This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the condition status.
